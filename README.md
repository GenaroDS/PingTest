# PingTest

PingTest is a simple and clean system tray icon that shows you the state of your internet connection with data and coloured icons to reflect its states. It uses multithreading to continuously perform a ping test in the background, with each iteration updating the system tray icon to reflect the current status of the test.

##What is a Ping Test?
A ping test is a method used to measure the speed and stability of an internet connection. It works by sending a small packet of data from your computer to a specific server and measuring the time it takes for the server to respond. The result is a measurement of the time it takes for your computer to communicate with the server, which can help identify issues with your internet connection.

## Screenshots
Below are some larger and clearer screenshots showcasing the program's system tray colour changing depending on your internet stability:

Each colour represents a different state. Blue means less than 9% of packet loss, green less than 18%, yellow less than 28%, and red more than that. The little clock is the first icon to appear, waiting for the results.

## Conclusion
By using PingTest, you can quickly and easily check the stability of your internet connection and identify any issues that may be affecting your connection speed. The program runs in the background, so you can continue using your computer as normal while PingTest works to keep you connected.
