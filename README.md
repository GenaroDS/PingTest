# PingTest
PingTest is a clean, lightweight system tray app that monitors your internet connection quality using colored icons and data. It employs multithreading for continuous background ping tests, updating the system tray icon with real-time results. Users can customize the ping test, changing the host, amount of pings, and other settings to tailor the monitoring to their specific needs.  
The ping test is easily customizable through the settings options available in the context menu of the system tray icon.

## What is a Ping Test?
A ping test measures the speed and stability of an internet connection by sending data packets between your computer and a server. This helps identify connection issues that impact activities requiring stable data transfer, like competitive gaming.

## Screenshots
The system tray icon changes color based on connection stability:

Colors represent different packet loss percentages: blue (<9%), green (<18%), yellow (<28%), and red (>=28%).  
Through the settings window, you can customize each threshold to your preference.
